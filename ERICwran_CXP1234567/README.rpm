This module builds an RPM only.
The rpm plugin is configured centrally for all TOR packages in the integration pom.

After a release version (non SNAPSHOT) is built the CI Fwk database needs to be updated.
This update is triggered when this file, README.rpm, is present.
Rename this file, using 'git mv', to temporarily disable deliveries.
